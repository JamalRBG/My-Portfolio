  <h2>Major Project</h2>
  <h3>Smart Agriculture Website</h3>
  <p>This is a responsive website I created to show how technology can help improve farming. It has different sections and a simple design to make it easy to use.</p>
  <p>I made this project during my second year at university as one of my first web development projects.</p>
  <p>Note: I'm still learning and improving my skills in JavaScript.</p>

  <h2>Minor Projects</h2>

  <h3>Desktop Applications & Testing (C# in Visual Studio)</h3>
  <p>During my studies, I developed desktop applications using C# in Visual Studio. These projects helped me understand the basics of Windows Forms, event-driven programming, and user interface design. The applications include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Simple Calculator</li>

    <li>Notepad Application</li>

  </ul>

  <p>I also practiced testing principles using Microsoft tools integrated in Visual Studio. I performed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Unit Testing</strong> – to ensure that individual methods and components work correctly</li>
    <li><strong>Domain Testing</strong> – to verify inputs and outputs based on the program’s expected behavior</li>
    <li><strong>Integration Testing</strong> – to test the interaction between multiple components or classes</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These tests were implemented in class libraries using the .NET Framework. I used Visual Studio’s built-in testing features to validate and maintain code quality throughout the development process.</p>

  <h3>Database Development</h3>
  <p>I have built and managed relational databases using MySQL. In these projects, I designed tables, enforced relationships using primary and foreign keys, and wrote SQL queries to insert, update, and retrieve data. I also connected the databases to web applications using PHP to perform real-time data transactions.</p>

  <h3>Structured Programming (C++)</h3>
  <p>In the Computer Simulation course, I applied structured programming concepts using C++. I created several programs, including one that generates pseudo-random numbers using methods such as the Linear Congruential Generator (LCG). These projects strengthened my understanding of logic building, control flow, and memory management in low-level programming.</p>

  <h2>UML Diagrams</h2>
  <p>I have designed different types of UML diagrams for software scenarios:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Class Diagram</li>

    <li>Use Case Diagram</li>

    <li>Activity Diagram</li>
