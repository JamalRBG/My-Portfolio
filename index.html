  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Hello, my name is <strong>JAMARI EMMANUEL RUBUGA</strong>. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering at Cyprus International University. Below are some of the projects I have completed to demonstrate my understanding of various programming languages and tools.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have categorized my work into two main parts: 
    <strong>Major Project</strong> – showcasing my skills in building a complete website; and 
    <strong>Minor Projects</strong> – including the development of desktop applications using C#, database design and interaction, C++ programming for simulations, and UML modeling for different scenarios.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am continually learning and working to improve my skills in areas such as JavaScript and backend development.

  <h2>Major Project</h2>
  <h3>Smart Agriculture Website</h3>
  <p>
    This project is a responsive and user-friendly website designed to highlight how modern technology can be applied to improve agricultural practices. The website includes several informative sections, a clean layout, and intuitive navigation to ensure accessibility for a wide range of users.
  </p>
  <p>
    I developed this website during my second year at university as part of my introduction to web development. It reflects my foundational skills in HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript, and serves as a stepping stone for more advanced projects in the future.

  <h2>Minor Projects</h2>

  <h3>Desktop Applications & Testing (C# in Visual Studio)</h3>
  <p>During my studies, I developed desktop applications using C# in Visual Studio. These projects helped me understand the basics of Windows Forms, event-driven programming, and user interface design. The applications include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Simple Calculator</li>

    <li>Notepad Application</li>
    <img src="images01/notepad.png" alt="Calculator Screenshot" class="project-image">
  </ul>

  <p>I also practiced testing principles using Microsoft tools integrated in Visual Studio. I performed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Unit Testing</strong> – to ensure that individual methods and components work correctly</li>
    <li><strong>Domain Testing</strong> – to verify inputs and outputs based on the program’s expected behavior</li>
    <li><strong>Integration Testing</strong> – to test the interaction between multiple components or classes</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These tests were implemented in class libraries using the .NET Framework. I used Visual Studio’s built-in testing features to validate and maintain code quality throughout the development process.</p>

  <h3>Database Development</h3>
  <p>I have built and managed relational databases using MySQL. In these projects, I designed tables, enforced relationships using primary and foreign keys, and wrote SQL queries to insert, update, and retrieve data. I also connected the databases to web applications using PHP to perform real-time data transactions.</p>

  <h3>Structured Programming (C++)</h3>
  <p>In the Computer Simulation course, I applied structured programming concepts using C++. I created several programs, including one that generates pseudo-random numbers using methods such as the Linear Congruential Generator (LCG). These projects strengthened my understanding of logic building, control flow, and memory management in low-level programming.</p>

  <h2>UML Diagrams</h2>
  <p>I have designed different types of UML diagrams for software scenarios:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Class Diagram</li>

    <li>Use Case Diagram</li>

    <li>Activity Diagram</li>
